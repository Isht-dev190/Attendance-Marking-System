for fedora 41
-- create mysql database
sudo dnf install mysql

-- add dependencies for mysql2 in your connection aka create pool function for database
const mysql = require('mysql2');

add dependencies like dotenv and fs
sudo dnf install dotenv
sudo dnf install fs



-- get the schema path
-- login in to your mysql by writing 'mysql -u root' and create a database, for the project create 'attendance_database'
Note: you must be login as the root user to access the database, by default the value for root is null

-- add the schema in the database
'mysql -u root attendance_database < ~/Sem5/DB/DBProject/backend/schema.sql'
--Note absolute paths work in this, if you can work it with a relative path, here's a star for you.



-- install dbeaver and postman for testing
-dbeaver is used to test the connection and insert values in the database
Note: mockaroo is a tool used to get temporary values to put in the database
-postman is a tool to test API's
by default our server is running at port 3000
by default our database is running at port 3306

--check admin route for the routes to use to get proper data
note: In the header of a post request you need to type 'Content-type' under the key section and under the value section write/select 'application/json', and always send the correct
json format for the functions in the correct order and correct value i.e if a table contains a primary key as id, dont send in the same id again.


-- to run the code, just install dependencies and run 'npm run dev' to start both the servers, our frontend is running at 
'localhost:3000'
